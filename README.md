- [Project Overview](#Project_Overview)

This comprehensive analysis explores the complex relationships between various risk factors and Alzheimer's disease. The project examines 74,283 records dataset, spanning 20 countries, revealing intriguing insights into the demographics, lifestyle, and health factors influencing Alzheimer's disease risk.

**Key Findings**
- Alzheimer's disease risk increases with age, with significant variations across countries and demographics.
- Diabetes, hypertension, family history, and genetic risk are prominent factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Lifestyle factors such as sleep quality, physical activity, and social engagement also play a crucial role in determining Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Education level, BMI, and cognitive test scores are correlated with Alzheimer's disease risk, particularly in individuals with a history of alcohol consumption.

The EDA phase aimed to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights from the dataset. The following key findings emerged:

1.  What was the total number of countries in the dataset?
2.  How does Alzheimer's disease risk vary by age group?
3.  What was the distribution of Alzheimer's disease risk in top five country having diabetes, Hypertension, family history, and genetic risk respectively?
4.  What was the distribution of Alzheimer's disease across different age group with genetic risk and family history?
5.  How does the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease vary across different country displaying average BMI, and cognitive test score?
6.  What was the significant differences between male and female in the dataset?
7.  What was the correlation between sleep quality, average BMI, and cognitive test score of Alzheimer's disease?
8.  Find the distribution employment status of developing Alzheimer's disease.
9.  How does smoking status influenced Alzheimerâ€™s disease risk?
10.  What was the relationship between alcohol consumption and Alzheimer's disease risk?
11.  What impact does family history has on Alzheimer's disease risk across respective gender?
12.  How does diabetes affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease for different respective country?
13. How does Body Mass Index (BMI) influenced prevalence of Alzheimer's disease risk across dietary habit and Genetics?
14.  How does social engagement level, urban, and rural living affected Alzheimer's disease?
15.  What were the average rate of education level, BMI, and cognitive test score for age group whom are alcoholic and liable to Alzheimer's disease?
16.  What were the percentage of depression level of countries with heart Alzheimer's disease risk?
17.  What were the average cognitive test scores rate for age group with Alzheimer's disease risk?
18.  What were the percentage of country with no Alzheimer's disease risk?
19.  What were the percentage of country with no Alzheimer's disease risk?


- [Results/Findings](#Results/Findings)
 
This comprehensive analysis explores the complex relationships between various risk factors and Alzheimer's disease, utilizing a dataset spanning 20 countries.

#### Key Demographic Findings
- Octogenarians (80-89 years) had the highest distribution of Alzheimer's disease risk (14.7%).
- Females (50.14%) outnumbered males (49.86%) in the dataset.
- Retired individuals were more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease.

#### Risk Factors and Correlations
- Diabetes, hypertension, family history, and genetic risk were prominent factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Sleep quality, physical activity, and social engagement played crucial roles in determining Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Genetic risk and family history were significant factors in Alzheimer's disease risk across different age groups.

#### Country-Specific Findings
- Russia had the highest prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, while Sweden had the lowest.
- Diabetes affected Alzheimer's disease risk differently across countries, with Russia having the highest risk (6.65%) and Canada having the lowest risk (3.84%).

#### Lifestyle and Health Factors
- Marital status impacted Alzheimer's disease risk, with single individuals being more susceptible.
- Dietary habits, social engagement levels, and urban/rural living environments influenced Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Smoking status and alcohol consumption also varied in their relationships with Alzheimer's disease risk.

#### Cognitive Test Scores and Education Levels
- Average cognitive test scores varied across age groups, with octogenarians having the lowest score (64).
- Education levels and BMI were correlated with Alzheimer's disease risk in individuals with a history of alcohol consumption.

#### epression Levels and Countries with No Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis
- Depression levels varied across countries, with low, medium, and high levels observed.
- Japan had the highest percentage of individuals with no Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (5.69%), while Mexico had the lowest percentage (4.26%).

  
- [Recommendation](#Recommendation)

#### Demographic Considerations
1. _Targeted interventions_: Focus on octogenarians (80-89 years) and females, who are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease.
2. _Retiree support_: Provide resources and support for retired individuals to mitigate Alzheimer's disease risk.
3. _Family support_: Offer support and resources for families with a history of Alzheimer's disease.

 #### Risk Factor Mitigation
4.Diabetes management: Implement effective diabetes management strategies to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk.
5.Healthy lifestyle promotion: Encourage physical activity, social engagement, and healthy sleep habits to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk.
