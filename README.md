- [Project Overview](#Project_Overview)

This comprehensive analysis explores the complex relationships between various risk factors and Alzheimer's disease. The project examines 74,283 records dataset, spanning 20 countries, revealing intriguing insights into the demographics, lifestyle, and health factors influencing Alzheimer's disease risk.

**Key Findings**
- Alzheimer's disease risk increases with age, with significant variations across countries and demographics.
- Diabetes, hypertension, family history, and genetic risk are prominent factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Lifestyle factors such as sleep quality, physical activity, and social engagement also play a crucial role in determining Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Education level, BMI, and cognitive test scores are correlated with Alzheimer's disease risk, particularly in individuals with a history of alcohol consumption.

This comprehensive analysis explores the complex relationships between various risk factors and Alzheimer's disease, utilizing a dataset spanning 20 countries.

**Key Demographic Findings**
- Octogenarians (80-89 years) had the highest distribution of Alzheimer's disease risk (14.7%).
- Females (50.14%) outnumbered males (49.86%) in the dataset.
- Retired individuals were more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease.

**Risk Factors and Correlations**
- Diabetes, hypertension, family history, and genetic risk were prominent factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Sleep quality, physical activity, and social engagement played crucial roles in determining Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Genetic risk and family history were significant factors in Alzheimer's disease risk across different age groups.

**Country-Specific Findings**
- Russia had the highest prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, while Sweden had the lowest.
- Diabetes affected Alzheimer's disease risk differently across countries, with Russia having the highest risk (6.65%) and Canada having the lowest risk (3.84%).

**Lifestyle and Health Factors**
- Marital status impacted Alzheimer's disease risk, with single individuals being more susceptible.
- Dietary habits, social engagement levels, and urban/rural living environments influenced Alzheimer's disease risk.
- Smoking status and alcohol consumption also varied in their relationships with Alzheimer's disease risk.

**Cognitive Test Scores and Education Levels**
- Average cognitive test scores varied across age groups, with octogenarians having the lowest score (64).
- Education levels and BMI were correlated with Alzheimer's disease risk in individuals with a history of alcohol consumption.

**Depression Levels and Countries with No Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis**
- Depression levels varied across countries, with low, medium, and high levels observed.
- Japan had the highest percentage of individuals with no Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (5.69%), while Mexico had the lowest percentage (4.26%).

  
- [Recommendation](#Recommendation)

**Demographic Considerations**
1. _Targeted interventions_: Focus on octogenarians (80-89 years) and females, who are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease.
2. _Retiree support_: Provide resources and support for retired individuals to mitigate Alzheimer's disease risk.
3. _Family support_: Offer support and resources for families with a history of Alzheimer's disease.

 **Risk Factor Mitigation**
4.Diabetes management: Implement effective diabetes management strategies to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk.
5.Healthy lifestyle promotion: Encourage physical activity, social engagement, and healthy sleep habits to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk.
6.Hypertension management: Develop strategies to manage hypertension and reduce Alzheimer's disease risk.

# Country-Specific Initiatives
7.Russia and Canada: Develop targeted interventions for Russia (high-risk) and Canada (low-risk) to address diabetes-related Alzheimer's disease risk.
8.Sweden: Investigate factors contributing to Sweden's low Alzheimer's disease prevalence.
9. _Mexico_: Implement initiatives to address Mexico's low percentage of individuals with no Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

# Healthcare System Enhancements
10. _Early detection and diagnosis_: Improve early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in high-risk groups.
11. _Personalized care_: Develop personalized care plans addressing individual risk factors, lifestyle, and health conditions.
12. _Interdisciplinary care teams_: Establish interdisciplinary care teams to provide comprehensive care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

# Public Health Awareness
13. _Education and awareness_: Launch public awareness campaigns highlighting Alzheimer's disease risk factors, prevention strategies, and available resources.
14. _Support networks_: Establish support networks for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, caregivers, and families.
15. _Community engagement_: Encourage community engagement and participation in Alzheimer's disease research and awareness initiatives.

# Research and Development
16. _Genetic research_: Conduct further research on genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.
17. _Lifestyle intervention studies_: Conduct studies on the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in reducing Alzheimer's disease risk.
18. _Biomarker development_: Develop biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

# Policy and Advocacy
19. _Policy development_: Develop policies addressing Alzheimer's disease risk factors, prevention strategies, and care services.
20. _Advocacy efforts_: Support advocacy efforts promoting awareness, research, and support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families.
